# Getting-and-cleaning-data

The run_analysis.R file is done as follows

1. The archive of the dataset that is being used is: 
   (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones), 
   and the url:(https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
   has been downloaded and unzipped, whilst it is zipped, into R.

2. The console is set to the directory called 'UCI HAR Dataset' which 
   is the name of the directory where the files are contained.

3. Check the run_analysis.R script for codes that are used. These codes manipulated the data, 
   reaching the end goal - a. merges the training and the test sets to create one data set,
   b. extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement,
   c. uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set,
   d. appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
   e. from the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average 
      of each variable for each activity and each subject.
    
4. This file/activity is based on the experiment that is being carried out to fill 'Human Activity Recognition' 
   database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) 
   while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors. 

5. A codebook describes the contents, structure, and layout of the data that is being collected. 
   The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent.
   
6. Check out tidy_data, a set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
